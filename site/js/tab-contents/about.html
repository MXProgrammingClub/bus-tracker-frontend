				The Middlesex Bus Tracker was first conceived in 2014 when the then Deans of Students, Carmen Beaton and Dan Sheff,
				wanted a way to remove the crowds of students waiting for the bus in the Concord Dunkin' Donuts. For two years, a
				group of students worked to create a tracking device, allowing students to know exactly where the bus is at all
				times.

				<b>Luke Giacalone `17</b>, <b>Ted Pyne `18</b>, and <b>Hyun Choi `17</b>.
